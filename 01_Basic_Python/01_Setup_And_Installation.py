# Topic: Python Setup and Installation
# ------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Introduction
# Before writing any Python program, we need to install Python on our system
# and set up a code editor or environment to write and run Python programs.
# In this section, we will learn how to:
# - Install Python
# - Set up a code editor (VS Code)
# - Verify installation
# - Run our first Python program


# 2. Installing Python
# Step 1: Visit the official Python website
#     https://www.python.org/downloads/
# Step 2: Click on "Download Python 3.x.x" (latest version)
# Step 3: Run the installer
# Step 4: VERY IMPORTANT — Check the box that says:
#         "Add Python to PATH"
# Step 5: Click "Install Now" and wait for the setup to finish.


# 3. Verifying Python Installation
# After installation:
# - Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux)
# - Type the following command and press Enter:
#       python --version
#   or
#       python3 --version
# If the installation was successful, you will see the Python version number.

# Example:
#       Python 3.12.1


# 4. Installing VS Code (Visual Studio Code)
# Step 1: Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/
# Step 2: Download and install VS Code.
# Step 3: Open VS Code and install the following extensions:
#     - Python (by Microsoft)
#     - Jupyter (optional, for notebooks)
# These extensions allow you to run Python code directly in VS Code.


# 5. Setting Up Python in VS Code
# Step 1: Open VS Code.
# Step 2: Create a new folder for your project (example: python-for-ai-ml).
# Step 3: Open the folder in VS Code.
# Step 4: Create a new file with the extension .py (example: first_program.py).
# Step 5: In the top-right corner, click “Run” or press Ctrl + F5 to execute your code.


# 6. Installing Jupyter Notebook (Optional but Recommended)
# Jupyter Notebook is an interactive tool used in AI and Data Science for writing code
# and explanations together in one place.

# To install Jupyter, open Command Prompt or Terminal and type:
#       pip install jupyterlab

# After installation, run Jupyter by typing:
#       jupyter notebook
# or
#       jupyter lab
# This will open Jupyter in your browser.


# 7. Running Your First Python Program
# Create a new file called first_program.py and write:

print("Hello, Hamna! Welcome to Python for AI/ML.")

# Save and run the file.
# If everything is installed correctly, the output will be:

# Output:
# Hello, Hamna! Welcome to Python for AI/ML.


# 8. Summary
# - Installed Python from the official website
# - Verified the installation using the command line
# - Installed and configured VS Code as the main editor
# - (Optional) Installed Jupyter Notebook for data and AI work
# - Successfully ran the first Python program
#
# You are now ready to start learning Python step by step!
